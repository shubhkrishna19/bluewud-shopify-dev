# AGENTS.md: The "Swarm" Orchestration Manual

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRATEGIC PIVOT (2026-01-21)**: The objective has shifted. We are no longer just "improving" the theme. We are building a pixel-perfect, feature-rich replica of **WoodenStreet.com** as our MVP baseline, then suppressing it.
> ALL agents must prioritize **WoodenStreet Parity** over experimental features.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent "Swarm" Protocol
1.  **The Architect**: Antigravity (Manager).
2.  **The Specialist**: You (Worker).
3.  **The Auditor**: Reviews against WoodenStreet.com.

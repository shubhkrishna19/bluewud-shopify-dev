## 🆘 SOS / Q&A
- **Issue**: The current "Whisper" sections are bleeding raw Tailwind classes that don't match the Empire Theme's compiled CSS.
- **Solution**: Forcing standard Liquid/CSS overrides in `woodenstreet-ui-overrides.css`.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- **2026-01-25 (Codex)**: **CSS consolidation executed.** Created `assets/woodenstreet-master.css`.
- **2026-01-25 (Antigravity)**: **EMERGENCY FIX DEPLOYED.** Detected and stripped massive git merge conflict markers from `theme.liquid` and `woodenstreet-master.css` that were causing "slop state". Restored site functionality.
=======
